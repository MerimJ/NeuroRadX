# 🧠 NeuroRadX
Multimodal Pituitary Radiomics with MRI & Hormonal Biomarkers

NeuroRadX is an end-to-end radiomics research pipeline for quantitative analysis of 
pituitary MRI scans. It integrates multi-sequence MRI (T1, T2, post-contrast), lesion 
segmentation masks, PyRadiomics features, and endocrine laboratory results (Prolactin, 
TSH, Free T4, Free T3) to explore diagnostic differentiation between prolactinomas and 
non-functioning adenomas.

## 🔬 Features
- DICOM → NIfTI conversion
- N4 bias correction, resampling, intensity normalization
- Integration of manual segmentation masks
- PyRadiomics feature extraction
- Multimodal dataset creation (radiomics + lab results)
- Baseline ML classifier (Random Forest)
- PCA, correlations, feature importance
- Google Colab-compatible pipeline
